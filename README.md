# Random-Forest-on-the-Titanic-Dataset

In this notebook, I explore the Titanic dataset. I use Bagging method and Adaboost methods as ensemble methods to improve accuracies of a simple Decision tree in predicting whether a passenger in titanic survived or not.


The dataset is included in the repo.
